### Bachelor Project: **"Visual Analysis of Temporal Linguistic Patterns for the Detection of Multigranular Concepts"**

This is the code submission for the Bachelor Project.
  
The relevant self written files are:
- app.py
- processor.py
- bpm/*.py (all files in this folder)
- static/js/vis.js
- static/css/style.css

Most remaining files are either automatically generated by Flask or Spacy, or are public libraries/frameworks.  
This repository does not contain the New York Times Annotated corpus, used for this project.
    
The Project is also hosted online.
Notable informations for the usage of the tool:
- The possible searchable timerange of the tool is 1987-01 to 2007-06. (The timerange in which the corpus provides data)  
- The processing can take some time (Anything between 1-15min, depending on the query), when the searchbar is "greyed" out (acutally looks more like a bright blue), it is processing. Sending additonal queries will slow the calculation down.
- ESPECIALLY dont leave the timeinterval at "Monthly" when analyzing a bigger timerange of multiple years. This will result take too long to process, and will clog the server, hindering other queries to process.
