This is the code submission for the Bachelor Thesis.
  
The relevant self written files are:
- app.py
- processor.py
- bpm/*.py (all files in this folder)
- static/js/vis.js
- static/css/style.css
- templates/index.html

Most remaining files are either automatically generated by Flask or Spacy, or are public libraries/frameworks.  
This repository does not contain the New York Times Annotated corpus that was used for this workspace.
    
The Project is also hosted online.
Notable informations for the usage of the tool:
- The possible searchable timerange of the tool is 1987-01 to 2007-06. (The timerange in which the corpus provides data)  
- The processing can take some time (Anything between 1-15min, depending on the query). When the search button is "greyed out" (actually looks more like a bright blue), it is processing. Sending additonal queries will slow the calculation down.
- Be especially careful when leaving the time interval at "Monthly" when also analyzing a timerange of multiple years. This will take very long to process, and will clog the server, hindering other queries to process.

Have fun, Manuel Strey
